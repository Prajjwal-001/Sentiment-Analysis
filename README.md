# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis project using VADAR model also applied Lemmatization with spaCy.
Can't upload the dataset file as it is too large so, i will write the link to that dataset. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/sentiment-analysis-python-youtube-tutorial/input.
I have utilised the above dataset and based my model On VADAR( Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner). To imporove my model's efficiency I used Lemmatization method using NLTL of python. Now, as we are aware that lemmatization is quite slow in processing so, I have used spaCy package of python to speed up my processing. I have deployed both of my models and tested the data with both the model: Using only VADAR and using VADAR alongwith Lemmatization with spaCY.
